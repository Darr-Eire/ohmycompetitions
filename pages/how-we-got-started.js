          Hey Pioneers! 👋
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          I've been mining Pi since way back — 6 years strong! 🔥  
          All that time I dreamed about building something cool for the Pi community...  
          but there was just one problem: I had absolutely ZERO knowledge about making apps or connecting to the Pi Network. 😅
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          Fast forward to now... after tons of trial and error, late nights, and a whole lotta coffee ☕,  
          OhMyCompetitions was born! 🎉  
          Built from scratch with love, hustle, and a massive passion for Pi.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-4">
          The goal?  
          👉 Bring the Pi community together.  
          👉 Give back to fellow Pioneers.  
          👉 Actually use Pi in fun, exciting ways!
        </p>
  
        <p className="mb-8">
          And this is only the beginning... 🚀💜
        </p>
  
        <p className="text-center font-semibold text-lg">
          Thanks for being part of the journey!  
          Let's keep building the Pi future together! 🌍
