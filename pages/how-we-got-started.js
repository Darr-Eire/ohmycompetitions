        <p>Hey Pioneers! 👋</p>
        <p>I've been mining Pi since way back — <strong>6 years strong!</strong> 🔥 All that time I dreamed about building something cool for the Pi community... but there was just one problem: I had absolutely <strong>ZERO knowledge</strong> about making apps or connecting to the Pi Network. 😅</p>
        <p>Fast forward to now... after tons of trial and error, late nights, and a whole lotta coffee ☕, OhMyCompetitions was born! 🛠️ Built from scratch with love, hustle, and a massive passion for Pi.</p>
        <p>The goal? 👉 Bring the Pi community together. 👉 Give back to fellow Pioneers. 👉 Actually use Pi in fun, exciting ways!</p>
        <p>And this is only the beginning... 🚀💜 Thanks for being part of the journey! Let's keep building the Pi future together! 🌍</p>
