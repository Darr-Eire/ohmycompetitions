          <p>Hey Pioneers! 👋</p>
  
          <p>
            I've been mining Pi since way back — 6 years strong! 🔥  
            All that time I dreamed about building something cool for the Pi community...  
            but there was just one problem: I had absolutely ZERO knowledge about making apps or connecting to the Pi Network. 😅
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Fast forward to now... after tons of trial and error, late nights, and a whole lotta coffee ☕,  
            OhMyCompetitions was born! 🛠️ Built from scratch with love, hustle, and a massive passion for Pi.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The goal? 👉 Bring the Pi community together.  
            👉 Give back to fellow Pioneers.  
            👉 Actually use Pi in fun, exciting ways!
          </p>
  
          <p>
            And this is only the beginning... 🚀💜  
            Thanks for being part of the journey!  
            Let's keep building the Pi future together! 🌍
          </p>
