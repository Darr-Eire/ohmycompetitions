# Prize Pool Logic and Cash Code Claim System - Implementation Report
*Implemented: June 26, 2025*

## üèÜ Prize Pool Logic Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### 50% Ticket Purchase Allocation
- **Calculation**: Automatically calculates 50% of each ticket purchase amount
- **Database Integration**: Updates `comp.prizePool` field in real-time with each purchase
- **Live Tracking**: Prize pool increases with every Pi transaction completion

### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Prize pool calculation (50% of payment)
const prizePoolAddition = paymentAmount * 0.5;

// Database update with both ticket count and prize pool
await db.collection('competitions').findOneAndUpdate(
  { 'comp.slug': slug },
  {
    $inc: { 
      'comp.ticketsSold': ticketQuantity,
      'comp.prizePool': prizePoolAddition
    }
  }
);
```

### Database Schema Updates
- **Competition Model**: Added `prizePool` field to track accumulated funds
- **Real-time Updates**: Prize pool updates alongside ticket sales
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of prize pool additions

### Verification
- ‚úÖ **Payment Integration**: Prize pool updates on successful Pi transactions
- ‚úÖ **Calculation Accuracy**: Exactly 50% of ticket price added to pool
- ‚úÖ **Live Tracking**: Real-time updates visible in competition data
- ‚úÖ **Persistence**: Prize pool data stored in MongoDB permanently

## üéØ Cash Code Claim System ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Claim Box Component (`PiCashClaimBox.jsx`)
- **Visual Design**: Prominent yellow/orange themed claim interface
- **Timer Display**: Live countdown showing minutes:seconds remaining (31:04 total)
- **Code Input**: Formatted input field for cash code entry
- **Status Updates**: Real-time feedback on claim attempts
- **Auto-expiry**: Automatic expiration handling with user notification

### Account Page Integration
- **Priority Display**: Claim box appears prominently when user wins
- **Real-time Checking**: Automatic winner status verification on page load
- **User Feedback**: Success/error messages with auto-dismiss
- **Seamless UX**: Integrated naturally into existing account dashboard

### API Endpoints

#### Winner Check API (`/api/pi-cash-code-winner-check`)
```javascript
// Checks if current user has active claim window
const winnerRecord = await PiCashCode.findOne({
  'winner.uid': uid,
  claimed: false,
  'winner.claimExpiresAt': { $gt: new Date() }
});
```

#### Claim Processing API (`/api/pi-cash-code-claim`)
- **Code Validation**: Compares submitted code with stored code
- **Time Verification**: Ensures claim is within 31:04 window
- **Pi Payout**: Automatic Pi transfer to winner's wallet
- **Claim Logging**: Records all claim attempts for audit trail
- **Anti-fraud**: Prevents double claims and invalid submissions

### Database Schema (`PiCashCode` Model)
```javascript
{
  code: String,              // Secret code (e.g., "ABCD-1234")
  weekStart: Date,           // Week period start
  expiresAt: Date,           // Code availability expires
  drawAt: Date,              // Winner selection time
  claimExpiresAt: Date,      // Claim window closes
  prizePool: Number,         // Total prize amount
  winner: {
    uid: String,             // Winner's Pi Network UID
    username: String,        // Winner's username
    selectedAt: Date,        // When they were chosen
    claimExpiresAt: Date     // Individual claim deadline
  },
  claimed: Boolean,          // Whether prize was claimed
  claimAttempts: [{          // Audit trail
    uid: String,
    submittedCode: String,
    timestamp: Date,
    success: Boolean
  }]
}
```

### Timer System
- **Precise Countdown**: Updates every second with exact time remaining
- **Visual Formatting**: MM:SS display format (31:04, 30:58, etc.)
- **Auto-expiry**: Automatically disables interface when time expires
- **Grace Period**: Clear warning when approaching expiration
