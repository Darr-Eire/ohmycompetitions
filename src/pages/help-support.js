    title: 'Pi Cash Code ‚Äî FAQ',

      ['What is Pi Cash Code?',

      ['How does it work?',
       'Every week, we pick one winner randomly from all eligible participants. A unique secret code is revealed and the chosen winner must enter it on the Pi Cash Code page within a strict time window.'],
      ['When does it happen?',
       'The secret code is revealed every Monday at 3:14 PM GMT and the winning Piioneer is selected the following Friday at 3:14 PM GMT. Keep your notifications on ‚Äî your name could come up!'],
      ['How long do I have to claim?',
       'You have exactly 31 minutes and 4 seconds (a nod to 3.14 Pi) to enter the secret code after the winner announcement. If you‚Äôre the winner, a special input box will appear for you to submit it.'],
      ['Where do I enter the code?',
       'Go to the official Pi Cash Code page while logged in. If you‚Äôre the selected winner, the input field will automatically appear ‚Äî but only during your claim window.'],
      ['What if I miss the window?',
       'If you don‚Äôt enter the code in time, the prize is forfeited ‚Äî there are no extensions. We recommend setting an alarm for every Friday at 3:14 PM and checking back just in case.'],
      ['What happens if nobody claims the prize?',
       'If the weekly prize goes unclaimed, it rolls over and doubles for the next week. This means bigger and bigger Pi jackpots until someone grabs the code and wins it all.'],
      ['How do I become eligible?',
       'To be eligible, make sure you‚Äôve entered at least one competition that week or logged in and played any ‚ÄúTry Your Skill‚Äù game. That‚Äôs it ‚Äî no extra steps needed.'],
      ['Can I win more than once?',
       'Yes! Every week is a new chance. As long as you remain active and engaged, you‚Äôre always eligible to be chosen again.'],
      ['Is it really random?',
       'Yes ‚Äî winners are picked using a transparent and tamper-proof randomization process and the code claim mechanism is triggered directly through the app‚Äôs backend for fairness.'],

    title: 'How to Claim if You Win',
    items: [
      ['I won a competition. How do I claim?',
       'First off ‚Äî congrats! üéâ If you win, you‚Äôll get a real-time in-app notification. Head to your dashboard to view the winning competition. If it‚Äôs a Pi Cash Code win, you‚Äôll need to enter the correct code before your claim timer runs out. For standard competitions, Pi is sent automatically.'],
      ['Do I need to verify my wallet?',
       'No additional wallet verification is required. Since you login with the official Pi Network, your Pi Wallet is already securely linked. All payouts are processed via the Pi SDK.'],
      ['When is Pi sent?',
       'For normal competitions, Pi is transferred directly to your linked wallet within moments of the competition ending. For Pi Cash Code, the prize is only released after you submit the correct code within the 31:04 time window.'],
      ['What if I win but don‚Äôt respond?',
       'If you miss your chance to claim (especially for time-sensitive events like Pi Cash Code), the prize either rolls over or is awarded to a backup winner depending on the rules. Be sure to turn on app notifications so you never miss out!'],
      ['Can I claim from anywhere in the world?',
       'Yes ‚Äî digital Pi prizes can be claimed globally. For physical items, we‚Äôll work with you to arrange shipping or an equivalent payout where possible.'],
      ['Where can I track my winnings?',
       'Your full history ‚Äî including tickets, entries, wins and prize status ‚Äî can be viewed in your "My Entries" dashboard anytime you‚Äôre logged in.'],
